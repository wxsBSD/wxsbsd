I'm Wesley Shields. I spend my time working on various things. My interests lie
in malware, protocols and reverse engineering. I like to hack on a wide range of
things in those areas. I'm also a retired FreeBSD committer where I spent many
years as a ports committer. If I'm not in front of a computer you can find me
rock climbing or with my family in the RTP area of North Carolina.

If you are looking to get in touch with me the best way is email
(wxs@{freebsd,atarininja}.org). I do use twitter if you're looking for more
regular updates from me.
